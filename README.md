## What It Does

1. Renames `your-name.image` to `your-name@2x.image`.
2. Duplicates `your-name@2x.image` to `your-name.image`.
3. Resizes `your-name.image` to half of its size.
4. Now you have `your-name.image` as the 1x image, and `your-name@2x.image` as the 2x image.

## Installation

1. Clone or download the source code.
2. Double-click `Retinafy.workflow` to install.
3. You're all set!
